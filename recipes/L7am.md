# Moroccan L7am bel Bar9oq (Lamb with Prunes)

## Ingredients

### Lamb and Prunes
- 2 lbs (900g) lamb shoulder or leg, cut into chunks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in 1/4 cup (60ml) warm water
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1/2 cup (75g) blanched almonds
- 1 cup (150g) prunes
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted
- Salt to taste
- 4 cups (1 liter) water or beef broth

### Garnish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. **Brown the lamb:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add lamb chunks and brown on all sides. Remove lamb and set aside.

2. **Cook the onions and garlic:** In the same pot, add chopped onions and cook until translucent. Add garlic and cook for another minute.

3. **Add spices:** Stir in ground ginger, ground cinnamon, turmeric, black pepper, and soaked saffron with its water. Mix well.

4. **Simmer the lamb:** Return the lamb to the pot. Add the cinnamon stick and salt. Pour in water or beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer, covered, for about 1 hour or until the lamb is tender.

5. **Prepare the prunes:** While the lamb is cooking, in a small saucepan, add the prunes and enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the prunes are soft. Drain the prunes and set aside.

6. **Add prunes and honey:** Once the lamb is tender, add the softened prunes, honey, and blanched almonds to the pot. Continue to simmer for another 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend and the sauce to thicken.

7. **Garnish and serve:** Transfer the lamb and prune mixture to a serving dish. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and chopped fresh cilantro.

Enjoy your Moroccan L7am bel Bar9oq, a delightful dish with a perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors!
