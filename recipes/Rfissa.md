# Traditional Moroccan Rfissa

## Ingredients

### Chicken and Lentil Stew
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups (400g) green lentils, rinsed
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in 1/4 cup (60ml) warm water
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro, tied with kitchen twine
- 1 bunch fresh parsley, tied with kitchen twine
- Salt to taste
- 6 cups (1.5 liters) water or chicken broth

### Msemmen (Moroccan Flatbread)
- 4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups (480ml) warm water
- 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil, for cooking

### Garnish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the msemmen dough:** In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Gradually add warm water, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into small balls, cover with a damp cloth, and let rest for 30 minutes.

2. **Cook the chicken and lentils:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chicken pieces and brown on all sides. Remove chicken and set aside. In the same pot, add chopped onions and cook until translucent. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in ginger, turmeric, black pepper, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. Return the chicken to the pot and mix well.

3. **Simmer:** Add lentils, soaked saffron with its water, cilantro, parsley, salt, and water or chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours or until the chicken and lentils are tender. Remove the cilantro and parsley bunches before serving.

4. **Prepare the msemmen:** On a lightly oiled surface, flatten each dough ball into a thin circle. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and cook each msemmen for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Repeat with remaining dough balls, keeping cooked msemmen warm.

5. **Serve:** Tear the msemmen into pieces and place them on a large serving dish. Pour the chicken and lentil stew over the msemmen. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.

Enjoy your traditional Moroccan Rfissa, a comforting and flavorful dish perfect for gatherings and special occasions!
