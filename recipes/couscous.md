## Instructions

1. **Prepare the couscous:** In a medium saucepan, bring water or chicken broth to a boil. Add olive oil and salt. Stir in couscous, cover, and remove from heat. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

2. **Brown the meat:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add lamb or chicken chunks and brown on all sides. Remove meat and set aside.

3. **Cook the vegetables:** In the same pot, add chopped onion and cook until translucent. Add carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips, zucchinis, pumpkin, and cabbage. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Add spices and meat:** Stir in cumin, coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, black pepper, paprika, allspice, and salt. Return the meat to the pot and mix well.

5. **Simmer:** Add enough water to cover the meat and vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer, covered, for about 1 hour or until the meat and vegetables are tender. Stir in chickpeas during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

6. **Combine and serve:** Fluff the couscous with a fork and transfer to a large serving dish. Top with the meat and vegetable mixture. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
