# Moroccan Djaj b Daghmira (Chicken with Onion Sauce)

## Ingredients

### Chicken and Onion Sauce
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
- 4 large onions, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in 1/4 cup (60ml) warm water
- Salt to taste
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro, tied with kitchen twine
- 1 bunch fresh parsley, tied with kitchen twine
- 4 cups (1 liter) water or chicken broth
- Juice of 1 lemon

### Garnish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lemon slices

## Instructions

1. **Marinate the chicken:** In a large bowl, mix the minced garlic, ground ginger, cumin, turmeric, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, and soaked saffron with its water. Add salt to taste. Coat the chicken pieces with the spice mixture, cover, and let it marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.

2. **Cook the chicken:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and brown on all sides. Remove the chicken and set aside.

3. **Cook the onions:** In the same pot, add the sliced onions and cook until they are soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.

4. **Combine and simmer:** Return the chicken to the pot. Add the bunches of cilantro and parsley, water or chicken broth, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer, covered, for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened. Remove the cilantro and parsley bunches before serving.

5. **Garnish and serve:** Transfer the chicken and onion sauce to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and lemon slices.
