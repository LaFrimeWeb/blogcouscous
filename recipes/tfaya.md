- 2 large onions, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in 1/4 cup (60ml) warm water
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Salt to taste
- 4 cups (1 liter) water or beef broth

### Tfaya (Caramelized Onions and Raisins)
- 3 large onions, thinly sliced
- 1 cup (150g) raisins
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup (120ml) water

### Couscous
- 2 cups (360g) couscous
- 2 cups (480ml) water or chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Garnish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Toasted almonds

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the lamb stew:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add lamb chunks and brown on all sides. Remove lamb and set aside.

2. **Cook the onions and garlic:** In the same pot, add finely chopped onions and cook until translucent. Add garlic and cook for another minute.

3. **Add spices:** Stir in ground ginger, ground cinnamon, turmeric, black pepper, and soaked saffron with its water. Mix well.

4. **Simmer the lamb:** Return the lamb to the pot. Add the cinnamon stick and salt. Pour in water or beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours or until the lamb is tender.

5. **Prepare the tfaya:** While the lamb is cooking, in a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add raisins, honey, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, turmeric, salt, and water. Continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes, until the raisins are plump and the mixture is thick and syrupy.

6. **Prepare the couscous:** In a medium saucepan, bring water or chicken broth to a boil. Add olive oil and salt. Stir in couscous, cover, and remove from heat. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

7. **Combine and serve:** Transfer the lamb stew to a large serving dish. Top with the tfaya (caramelized onions and raisins). Serve with fluffed couscous on the side. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and toasted almonds.

Enjoy your Moroccan Tfaya, a delectable dish that combines tender lamb with sweet and savory caramelized onions and raisins!
