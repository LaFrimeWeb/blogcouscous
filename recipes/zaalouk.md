# Moroccan Zaalouk (Eggplant and Tomato Salad)

## Ingredients
- 2 large eggplants
- 4 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground chili powder (optional, for a spicy kick)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Salt to taste
- Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the eggplants:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Prick the eggplants with a fork and place them on a baking sheet. Roast for about 30 minutes, or until the eggplants are tender and the skins are wrinkled. Remove from oven, let cool slightly, then peel and chop the eggplant flesh.

2. **Cook the tomatoes:** In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to break down and release their juices.

3. **Add garlic and spices:** Stir in the minced garlic, ground cumin, ground paprika, ground chili powder (if using), black pepper, turmeric, and ginger. Cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend.

4. **Combine eggplants and tomatoes:** Add the chopped eggplant flesh to the tomato mixture. Stir in the tomato paste and lemon juice. Continue to cook over medium heat for another 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and well combined. Add salt to taste.

5. **Serve:** Transfer the Zaalouk to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature with crusty bread or as a side dish.

Enjoy your Moroccan Zaalouk, a delicious and healthy salad that's bursting with Mediterranean flavors!
